# Codex rules for this repo

## Authority
- Treat documentation in /docs as authoritative.
- Do not invent APIs not present in /docs.
- If /docs and code disagree, ask before changing code.

## Working mode
- Default to analysis-first.
- Before editing files: present a plan and list the files to change.
- Prefer small, reviewable diffs.

## Referencing docs
- When using a library API, quote the relevant snippet or point to the exact docs file + heading.
- If the answer depends on version, state which docs file it came from.
